<p><!--<strong>PERSONAL PROTECTION SERVICES (BODYGUARDING)-->  </strong>During these unprecedented times as we go through the Covid-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdowns, safety and security of customers, clients and business/residential premises have become of paramount importance
<br>
All our guards that perform this service are ex-military or security personnel who have undertaken advanced security and driver training and have qualified in a high-tier skill level enabling them to perform such duties.
</p>

<p><!--<strong>CASH & GOODS IN-TRANSIT </strong>-->Thatâ€™s why BAC services have introduced a range of security options specific to operating as normal as possible through such conditions. </p>
